                <h2>Eagle Scout Project</h2>
                <p>One of the requirements of becoming an Eagle Scout is to complete an
                    Eagle Scout project. My project was to wash and paint the Knights of Columbus
                    hall in Needville, Texas. For my project, I organized a day where scouts carpooled
                    an hour and a half to the hall. We spent the day powerwashing about 2,000 square feet of the 
                    patio and painted the front side of the building with 3 layers of paint. We also repainted
                    the benches, which gave the hall a brand new look. Organizing this project was a 
                    great expereince for me. This was my first time leading a large group project. 
                    I had to organize the logistics of the project, keep track of the costs, and 
                    delegate tasks to scouts and adults.
