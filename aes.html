                <h2>AES</h2>
                <p>This project was one of my projects for Hardware Security 1 & 2 (ELEC 5210 & ELEC 5290).
                    It uses combinational logic to implement AES on an FPGA
                    and uses UART to communicate with a PC.
                    After implementing the AES algorithm in ECB mode, I was able to
                    revise my implementation to encrypt in CTR mode. 
                    In CTR mode the system encrypts a counter concatenated with a nonce and then XOR's
                    that output with the plaintext. This helps significantly reduce the amount of computer
                    hardware required to implement AES. Because AES is a very expensive algorithm, 
                    implementing it in hardware can significantly reduce its power consumption - 
                    especially for large amounts of data.
