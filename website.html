    About Me
  </h1>

  <p>
    I am a student studying computer engineering at Auburn University. In school, I am focused on learning as much 
    as I can about embedded system design and machine learning. In the future I would like to combine the two, and 
    develop efficient machine learning models that can be run on embedded systems in real world applications.
    Outside of school, I like to work on personal coding projects, and I have descriptions about the ones I 
    have finished shown below. I also enjoy hunting, hiking, and golfing in my free time, and I am currently
    training to do a triathalon in September.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Wordle:
  </h2>
  <p>
    My first project ever was a program that solves the wordle game. This was my first time working on a 
    large scale project like this, so the project ended up being very messy. The program ended up working
    reasonbly well, and had a success rate of around 90%, which was found using a Monte Carlo simulation.
    During the project I learned a lot about code readabliity the hard way. I learned that it is import to
    comment what a program is doing, but why it is doing it. I also learned how NOT to use for loops, and 
    how quickly they can increase runtime. In the future I may try to improve the bots performance, however, I am
    satisfied with how it performs right now and am currently focusing on my other projects.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Starfall:
  </h2>
  <p>
    My second project was a productivity app. Some friends and I joined a hackathon in February of 2024, and spent
    almost 24 hours straight coding an app that has functions of several different productivity apps all combined 
    into one app. The biggest challenge my group and I faced was that three of us had never coded in SwiftUI before,
    and two of us didn't even own macs and had to rent some from the school. With my group, we were able to get
    a funcitoning app within 24 hours. The app included a focus timer, a to do list, a notes app, a calendar that
    syncs with your Apple calendar, and a health app that automatically saves to a folder in your notes app. 
    During this project I learned how to work with a team, and learned how to adapt to a new coding language.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Stockbot:
  </h2>
  <p>
    My third project is a machine learning model that predicts future close prices. The algorithm uses a random
    forest algorithm from the sci-kit learn library. The model uses about 10 years worth of data to predict future
    close prices. It uses an 80/20 split for training and testing, and preforms well in testing, however it
    struggles in preditcing future prices. I am currently working on that program to improve its accuracy as
    well as introducing new features. Currently I am working on creating a python web scraper to automatically
    update the data used in the model, and I am planning on using competitor data for the Ford model to try and 
    improve its performance.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Closing remarks:
  </h2>
  <p>
    These coding projects are a lot of fun for me. I enjoy making programs that help me do the things I enjoy.
    I have several projects that I would like to work on in the future, such as a segmentation model that I can use
    at my ranch to count the number of cows in a pasture, a neural network that can play pokemon, and
    a browser game. I am very proud of my personal projects, it is very fulfilling to see my friends get mad
    about losing to my wordle bot, or to be able to use the app I made, or to see my random forest model guess 
    a stock price.
