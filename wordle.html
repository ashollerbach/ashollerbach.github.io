                <h2>Wordle</h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first ever software project.
                    During my sophomore year of college, Wordle was blowing up online and 
                    I decided to make a program that could solve the Wordle. 
                    I created an algorithm that finds the word that eliminates the most
                    words from a selected word list. The program then takes a word that 
                    the user inputs and removes invalid words from the list. To test this,
                    I made a Monte Carlo simulation, and over large amounts of trails, generally 
                    1,000 to 1,000,000, the program would sucessfully guess the correct word over 
                    95% of the time.  
                </p>

    </div>

    <script>
        fetch('_sidebar.html')
            .then(response => {
                if (!response.ok) {
                    throw new Error("Network response was not ok " + response.statusText);
                }
                return response.text();
            })
            .then(data => {
                document.getElementById('sidebar-placeholder').innerHTML = data;
            })
            .catch(error => {
                console.error('There has been a problem with your fetch operation:', error);
                document.getElementById('sidebar-placeholder').innerHTML = '<p style="color:red; padding: 20px;">Error loading navigation.</p>';
            });
    </script>
