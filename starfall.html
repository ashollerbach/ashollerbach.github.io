                <h2>Starfall</h2>
                <p>In 2024, I attended a hackathon. I worked in a group of 4 in order to develop
                    a productivity app that contains a focus timer, a note taking feature that interfaces with 
                    your IOS notes app, a calendar that syncs with your IOS calendar,
                    and a feature that helps you keep track of your physical and mental health.
                    Going into this, our group had no experience with IOS development,
                    and two of had to rent Macbooks from the university. We stayed up all night
                    working on this project (I ended up getting about an hour and a half of sleep
                    on the Brown-Koppel basement floor). We were very happy with how well the app 
                    worked, especially considering the lack of expereience we had.
